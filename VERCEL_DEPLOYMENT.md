# Vercel Deployment Guide for Elite Filing Frontend

This guide will help you deploy the Elite Filing frontend to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

1. **Vercel Account**: Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. **Git Repository**: Your code should be in a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
3. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed locally

## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to Git**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Vercel configuration for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your Git repository
   - Select the repository containing your Elite Filing project

3. **Configure the project**:
   - **Framework Preset**: Select "Create React App"
   - **Root Directory**: Leave as `.` (root)
   - **Build Command**: `cd frontend && npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `frontend/build`
   - **Install Command**: `cd frontend && npm install`

4. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application
   - You'll get a live URL once deployment is complete

### Method 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy from project root**:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Set up and deploy: `Y`
   - Which scope: Select your account
   - Link to existing project: `N` (for first deployment)
   - Project name: `elite-filing-frontend`
   - Directory: `.` (current directory)

## Configuration Files

The following files have been created for optimal Vercel deployment:

### `vercel.json`
- Configures build settings for the React frontend
- Sets up proper routing for single-page application
- Handles static file serving

### `.vercelignore`
- Excludes unnecessary files from deployment
- Reduces deployment size and improves performance
- Excludes backend files since we're only deploying frontend

## Environment Variables

**Important**: Your frontend uses the following environment variable that must be configured:

- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: The base URL for your backend API

### Setting Environment Variables:

1. **In Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to your project settings
   - Navigate to "Environment Variables"
   - Add `REACT_APP_API_URL` with your production backend URL
   - Example: `https://your-backend-domain.com/api`

2. **Via CLI**:
   ```bash
   vercel env add REACT_APP_API_URL
   ```

**Note**: A `.env.example` file has been created in the frontend directory to document required environment variables.

## Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **In Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to your project settings
   - Navigate to "Domains"
   - Add your custom domain
   - Follow DNS configuration instructions

## Automatic Deployments

Once connected to Git:
- **Production**: Pushes to `main` branch trigger production deployments
- **Preview**: Pushes to other branches create preview deployments
- **Pull Requests**: Automatically get preview deployments

## Build Optimization

The build completed successfully with:
- **Main JS Bundle**: 103.63 kB (gzipped)
- **Main CSS Bundle**: 9.14 kB (gzipped)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Failures**:
   - Check that `npm run build` works locally
   - Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Check for ESLint warnings (they won't break the build but should be addressed)

2. **Routing Issues**:
   - The `vercel.json` configuration handles SPA routing
   - All routes will serve `index.html` for client-side routing

3. **Asset Loading Issues**:
   - Ensure all assets are in the `public` folder or imported in components
   - Check that asset paths are relative

### Current Warnings to Address:
- ESLint warnings in components (useEffect dependencies)
- Unused variables in fileSlice.js

These warnings don't prevent deployment but should be fixed for code quality.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Vercel using Method 1 or 2 above
2. Test the deployed application
3. Set up custom domain if needed
4. Configure environment variables for production
5. Set up monitoring and analytics
