              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                LeadMagnet was born from a simple frustration: traditional lead generation 
                methods were time-consuming, expensive, and often ineffective. Our founder, 
                Alex Thompson, spent years in the trenches of business development, watching 
                companies struggle to find and connect with their ideal customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2023, Alex assembled a team of AI specialists, marketing experts, and 
                automation engineers with one goal: create a platform that could generate 
                high-quality leads at scale using the power of artificial intelligence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, LeadMagnet serves hundreds of businesses worldwide, from startups to 
                enterprise companies, helping them achieve consistent, predictable growth 
                through our multi-platform lead generation system.
